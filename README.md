## How to transfer messages to the LED Badge

1. Scan the QR code on the back of the LED badge to get to the website at badgemagic.fossasia.org. 
2. Choose the right app for you and install it (Android, iOS, Python).
3. Enable your mobile's Bluetooth. There is no need to pair it with the LED badge, as it pairs devices using Bluetooth Low Energy automatically.
4. Open the app and enter your desired message.
5. Turn on the LED badge by pressing the top button on the side of the badge and press again to activate the Bluetooth transfer mode. It will show a Bluetooth image.
6. Click transfer / send on the app to transmit the message.

Note: The second lower button on the badge is used to switch to different messages, currently available only on the iOS app. We plan to implement this function on the Android app in future.
