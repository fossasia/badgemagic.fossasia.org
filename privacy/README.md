### Privacy Policy for LED Badge Magic Android App

**Last updated: 11 May 2024**

This privacy policy governs your use of the software application LED Badge Magic (“Application”) for mobile devices that was created by FOSSASIA. The Application is designed to allow users to create and transfer display messages to LED badges via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).

**1. User Provided Information**

The Application does not require users to provide any personal information. Users can download and use the Application without providing information such as name, email address, or other details.

**2. Automatically Collected Information**

The Application does not collect any information automatically from your device.

**3. Location Permissions for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)**

The Application requires location permissions to operate Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) functionalities effectively:

- **Foreground Location Permission**: The Application needs access to your device's precise location while it is in use (foreground) to identify and connect to nearby devices. This permission is necessary to transfer badge data to the identified devices via BLE.

- **Background Location Permission**: The Application requires access to your device's location in the background to continuously scan and identify nearby objects that can receive badge data. This ensures that the application can maintain connections and transfer data to devices even when the app is not actively in use.

Location data accessed for BLE functionalities is not stored on the device, transferred to our servers, or shared with third parties. These permissions are solely used to facilitate the connection and data transfer between your device and nearby BLE devices.

**4. Bluetooth Access**

The Application requires access to your device’s Bluetooth functionality to communicate with LED badges. This access is used exclusively for detecting and connecting to LED badges within the proximity of your device to facilitate the transfer of display messages. The Application does not use Bluetooth access for any other purposes nor does it track your location.

**5. Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by the Application?**

No. We do not share any information with third parties since the Application does not collect, store, or process any personal data.

**6. Data Retention Policy, Managing Your Information**

Since the Application does not collect, store, or process any personal data, there is no data retention policy applicable to this Application.

**7. Children**

We do not use the Application to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with information without their consent, he or she should contact us.

**8. Security**

We are concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. However, please be aware that no security system can prevent all potential security breaches.

**9. Changes**

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. We will notify you of any changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy here and informing you via app update notes. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.
